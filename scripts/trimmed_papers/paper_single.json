Existing methods used to block translation lack the spatiotemporal precision to investigate cell-49 specific contributions to consolidation of long-term memories. Here, we have developed a novel chemogenetic 50 mouse resource for cell type-specific and drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibition (ciPSI) that utilizes an 51 engineered version of the catalytic kinase domain of dsRNA-activated protein (PKR). ciPSI allows rapid and 52 reversible phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 causing a block on general translation by 50% in vivo. Using this resource, 53 we discovered that temporally structured pan-neuronal protein synthesis is required for consolidation of long-54 term auditory threat memory. Targeted protein synthesis inhibition in CamK2\u03b1 expressing glutamatergic 55 neurons in lateral amygdala (LA) impaired long-term memory, which was recovered with artificial chemogenetic 56 reactivation at the cost of stimulus generalization. Conversely, genetically reducing phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in 57 CamK2\u03b1 positive neurons in LA enhanced memory strength, but was accompanied with reduced memory 58 fidelity and behavior inflexibility.

Here, we have developed a novel cell type-specific drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibitor (ciPSI) that utilizes an inducible Nes.iPKR pan-neuronal ciPSI knock-in mice, which were viable and fertile. The Nes-iPKR mice expressedEGFP-L10 in all neurons in the amygdala, as marked by complete overlap with NeuN staining (Fig. 1d) , as well 162 as in cortical areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex and somatosensory cortex, and hippocampal areas, 163 CA1 and CA3, and the dentate gyrus (Supplemental Fig. 2c-g) . Despite heterozygous deletion of Eef1a1 allele 164 and expression of the multicistronic cassette in Nes.iPKR mice, the mice displayed normal spontaneous 165 locomotion as well as thigmotaxis in open field tests (Supplemental Fig. 3a-c) .To test the efficiency of ciPSI in blocking protein synthesis ex vivo, amygdala slices of Nes.iPKR mice 168 and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino-acid tagging (BONCAT) 27 surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) 28 , that measures translation elongation and is amenable for in vivo 174 labeling, was used to test ciPSI efficiency in awake behaving mice. SUnSET immunoblot showed that 175 Nes.iPKR mice centrally infused with 150 pg ASV exhibited a robust decrease in protein synthesis (~50%) 176 compared to controls (Fig. 2b) . The inhibition of protein synthesis was concomitant with a specific increase in 177 phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at 1h post ASV treatment both ex vivo (Fig. 2c ) and in vivo (Fig. 2d) , with no effect 178 on either the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) 179 pathways (Fig. 2d ). Next, we investigated the ASV pharmacokinetics in Nes.iPKR amygdala lysates by 180 harvesting tissue at increasing time points after drug infusion. We found that peak expression of iPKR is 181 reached at 0.5h, which steadily declines at 1h and 3h and is completely degraded by 6h (Fig. 2e) .Subsequently, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 steadily increased at 0.5h and 1h and then declined to baseline at 3h.As a result of phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, proteins whose transcripts harbor uORFs, specifically ATF4 and 184 GADD34, accumulated and remained at higher levels compared to control until 3h (Fig. 2e) . GADD34 is the 185 regulatory subunit of the eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase 17 , and the negative feedback due to increased GADD34 levels 186 combined with the degradation of iPKR by NS3/4 protease at 3h time point might be responsible for reduced synthesis 29, 30 . To determine whether chemogenetic inhibition of pan-neuronal protein synthesis influences persistent cortical and thalamic input-specific synaptic potentiation in principal excitatory neurons within LA 37, 232 38 . Thus, we asked whether de novo protein synthesis in CamK2\u03b1-positive principal neurons in LA is necessary 233 for aversive memory consolidation. We virally delivered CamK2\u03b1.Cre.EGFP into the bilateral LA of iPKR mice 234 and control mice (Fig. 4a) . Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was increased specifically in CamK2\u03b1.iPKR neurons 235 compared to wild-type mice and non-EGFP positive neurons in the same animals ( Fig. 4b) with a 236 corresponding decrease in de novo translation (Fig. 4c ) upon ASV administration. CamK2\u03b1.iPKR mice were 237 threat conditioned as previously and centrally infused with ASV immediately after training (Fig. 4d ).CamK2\u03b1.iPKR mice were comparable to wild-type controls in memory acquisition (Fig. 4e ), but LTM tested 24h 239 later was significantly impaired (Fig. 4f-h) . This LTM consolidation deficit with ciPSI was prevented by pre-240 training administration of ISRIB, a drug that rescues the p-eIF2\u03b1 mediated constraint on general translation by 241 enhancing the activity of eIF2B ( Fig. 4g -h) 39 . We also tested ASV-treated CamK2\u03b1.iPKR mice in open field test 242 and elevated plus maze to gauze anxiety related behaviors and found that although spontaneous locomotion It is evident that the translation program regulated by eIF2\u03b1 is necessary for LTM consolidation; 247 however, the accumulation of ATF4 raises the question of whether it is either decreased protein synthesis or 248 increased ATF4 levels causing the memory deficit. Indeed, a previous study has reported that even in the Fig. 5b ), but strongly impaired LTM (Supplemental 261 Fig. 5c and d) . Together, the LTM deficit observed using two independent approaches for blocking translation 262 initiation in CamK2\u03b1.iPKR and CamK2\u03b1.4Ekd respectively strongly support our hypothesis that de novo 263 translation in LA Camk2\u03b1+ neurons is necessary for consolidation of long-term threat memories..

Congruently, although all of the mice learned auditory threat 274 conditioning (Fig. 5c) CamK2a.iPKR mice were completely rescued by dephosphorylating both alleles of eIF2\u03b1, but was unaltered by 280 dephosphorylating one allele of eIF2\u03b1 ( Fig. 5e-f ). This indicated that the translation tone and LTM 281 consolidation process is set by the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, even when the abundance of phosphorylatable 282 eIF2\u03b1 is reduced by half, and confirmed that the memory deficit caused by iPKR is through the phosphorylation 283 of eIF2\u03b1 and not due to non-specific cellular toxicity.Notably, the memory enhancement in the CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice came with a cost. We found that 286 the dysregulated increase in translation tone in CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice resulted in impaired behavioral 287 flexibility during the tone offset in LTM test. CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice freeze starting at tone onset, but 288 continue to freeze after the tone offset during inter-trial interval epochs (Supplemental Fig. 6b and Fig. 5g ).This failure to switch off defensive state is triggered only after the onset of first tone while at pre-conditioned The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We injected a cocktail of AAV.CamK2\u03b1.Cre together with control mice in a differential threat conditioning paradigm that involves three interleaved presentations of a 307 paired tone (CS+) and an unpaired tone (CS-) in a single session (Fig. 6c-d) . Consistent with earlier data, post-308 training ASV infusion impaired LTM and led to a significant decline in freezing response to paired tone ( Fig. 6f To further understand what happens when eIF2\u03b1-controlled general translation in LA principal neurons 319 is boosted during consolidation of a complex memory, we explored differential threat conditioning in CamK2\u03b1 320 eIF2\u03b1 S51A mice (Supplemental Fig. 7c ). We found that whereas homozygous CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice can 321 discriminate between CS+ and CS-during LTM, they have a significantly increased freezing response to CS-.On the other hand, CamK2\u03b1 wild-type mice robustly discriminated CS+ from CS-and displayed negligible 323 freezing response to CS-(Supplemental Fig. 7d ). The enhanced CS-response in theCamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) 324 mice resulted in a poor discrimination index (Supplemental Fig. 7e ). We next examined the freezing during ITI, 325 and found that similar to earlier results with simple threat conditioning, CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) exhibited a 326 significantly increased freezing response following tone offset, indicating behavioral inflexibility (Supplemental 327 Fig. 7f We have used multi-pronged chemogenetic approaches to investigate the translational control of long- The electrophysiology experiments were performed as previously described 29, 51 and mice were between 2 and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Nes.iPKR amygdala slices treated with 1 \u00b5M ASV exhibited a sharp decline in de 170 novo translation (~20%) compared with controls (Fig. 2a). Because BONCAT uses azidohomoalanine (AHA), a 171 synthetic methionine analog, which can get outcompeted by endogenous methionine in vivo, this method does 172 not sufficiently label de novo translation in vivo. Thus, an independent method of labeling de novo translation, 173243was normal in these animals, there was a significant increase in the percentage of time spent in the open arm,244indicating reduced anxiety related behavior (SupplementalFig. 4a-e).290 stimulus (CS) the animals have normal motor behavior, indicating absence of generalized anxiety or contextual 291 threat response. We next tested CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) animals in open field arena and elevated plus maze, and 292 found normal locomotion in open field (Supplemental Fig. 6c-e), but a decrease in the percentage of time spent 293 in the open arm in the elevated plus maze, indicative of increased anxiety-like behavior (Supplemental Fig. 6f-294 h). These data suggest that a dysregulated increase in the translation program regulated by eIF2\u03b1 leads to a 295 failure in risk assessment in non-threatful environments and epochs. 296 297 Dysregulated protein synthesis in LA CamK2\u03b1+ neurons compromises the precision of a complex 298 memory 299 Finally, we addressed whether lost memories can be rescued with artificial reactivation 43 of LA 300 CamK2\u03b1+ principal neurons. Designer drug activated by designer drug (DREADD) hM3Dq mediated neuronal356FKBP-PKR (fPKR) induced phosphorylation eIF2\u03b1 by 1.5 fold without blocking general translation and thus, 357 they attributed the memory deficit in fPKR expressing animals to ATF4 expression. It is possible that because 358 these investigators injected the drug inducer of fPKR (AP20187) 2h before radioisotope S35 methionine 359 injection i.p., the sensitive time window for protein synthesis disruption was missed during labeling. Compared 360 to fPKR, PKR kinase domain (PKRk) is more effective in suppressing translation because it not only directly 361 phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, but it also interacts with and phosphorylates endogenous full-length PKR, further 362 boosting eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation 48 . In our system, central infusion of ASV resulted in 2-fold increase in 363 phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, which resulted in a robust 50% decrease of general translation as assessed with in vivo 364 SUnSET that involved local infusion of puromycin directly into lateral amygdala. Our convergent data from a365 parallel strategy of cell autonomous protein synthesis inhibition in LA CamK2\u03b1+ neurons using a synthetic 366 micro-RNA against eIF4E provides further support for the requirement of de novo protein synthesis in long-367 term memory consolidation. Nonetheless, we also observed an increase in ATF4 levels following 368 phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and cannot exclude the possibility that the memory deficit in the iPKR transgenic 369 mice is in part due to upregulated translation of transcripts containing uORFs, such as ATF4 and the ensuing 370 repression of CREB-regulated genes. 371 372 Memory generalization and behavioral inflexibility as a result of dysregulated translation 373 Several studies have used IEG-based engram cell targeting approaches to interrogate the nature of 374 memory formation and recall. Artificial reactivation of conditioned threat engram cells in LA using optogenetics 375 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a generalization. We propose that learning-induced somatic and synaptic protein synthesis functions to stabilize 381 the connections between the pathway-specific afferents from conditioned tone processing brain regions 382 (auditory cortex and auditory thalamus) to amygdalar engram cells in such a way that the conditioned tone can 383 access and activate the downstream neuronal network in the LA during recall. This natural cue-elicited 384 neuronal reactivation is incompletely recapitulated by artificial reactivation of LA neurons, such that there is 385 imprecise restoration of the memory, perhaps due to a lack of reinstatement of synapse specificity of the 386 original memory trace. Phospho-mutant eIF2\u03b1 mice, with a rigid increase in translation in LA principal neurons, 387 also exhibit stimulus generalization and behavioral inflexibility at tone offset. Taken together, our data indicate 388 that a finely tuned translation program in the amygdala is required to coordinate the stability and precision of 389 the long-term memory trace. 390 391 Model of protein synthesis regulation during long-term memory consolidation 392 Based on our data, we propose the following cellular/molecular model of protein synthesis regulation in 393 lateral amygdala during long-term consolidation. Cued threat conditioning leads to a coordinated increase in 394 protein synthesis in CamK2\u03b1+ neurons in the soma and in local subcellular compartments, such as dendritic 395 spines and axons. This results in robust memory strength and precision (Fig. 7a). Chemogenetic inhibition of 396 protein synthesis using iPKR blocks general translation in LA CamK2\u03b1+ neurons resulting in memory loss (Fig. 397 7b). Expression of biallelic phosphomutant eIF2\u03b1 in LA CamK2\u03b1+ neurons, although insensitive to iPKR-398 mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, results in an aberrant increase in basal translation. This leads to robust399 memory strength, but low memory precision.(Fig. 7c). Artificial chemogenetic reactivation of CamK2\u03b1+ 400 neurons following inhibition of protein synthesis leads to an increase in protein synthesis, but does not 401 recapitulate learning-induced local translation, thus causing memory generalization. This is manifested as 402 normalized memory strength and low memory precision(Fig. 7d).497 3.50 mm ML, -4.60 mm DV) of eIF2\u03b1 (A/+) or eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice, respectively. Finally, CamK2\u03b1.iPKR eIF2\u03b1 498 (A/+) and (A/A) mice were generated by injecting 100 nl of AAV1.Camk2\u03b1.CRE into the lateral amygdala (-1.40 499 mm AP, +/-3.50 mm ML, -4.60 mm DV) of double transgenic floxed iPKR and eIF2\u03b1 (A/+) or eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice, 500 respectively. Control wild-type littermates were injected with AAV9.Camk2\u03b1.Cre.EGFP.504 4 months of age at the time of the experiments. Briefly, transverse slices (300 \u03bcm) containing the amygdala 505 were isolated and transferred to recording chambers (preheated to 32\u00b0C), where they were superfused with 506 oxygenated aCSF (composition in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 25 NaHCO 3 , 25 D-glucose, 2 CaCl 2 507 and 1 MgCl 2 ) at least 1 hr before recordings began at a rate of 2 ml/min. In most of the experiments picrotoxin508 (75 \u03bcM) was present in the perfusion solution. For bath application the drugs were made and stored as 509 concentrated stock solutions and diluted 1000-fold when applied to the perfusate. Field excitatory postsynaptic 510 potentials (fEPSPs) from the internal capsule pathway were recorded using microelectrodes filled with artificial 511 cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; resistance 1-4 M\u2126). A bipolar Teflon-coated platinum electrode was placed in the 512 thalamic afferent fiber to the lateral amygdala, which is located in the ventral part of the striatum just above the 513 central nucleus of the amygdala. The test stimuli for basal synaptic response was at 0.05 Hz. In all 514 experiments, basal field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were stable for at least 20 min before the 515 start of each experiment. L-LTP was induced with three 1 sec 100-Hz high-frequency stimulation (HFS) trains, 516 with an intertrain interval of 60 sec. After induction of L-LTP, we collected fEPSPs for an additional 120 min. 5 517 nM ASV or vehicle were bath applied 10 min before L-LTP induction and lasted for all the recording. Slope 518 values were compared from the Nes.iPKR transgenic mice and their control littermates treated with either ASV digitized using the A-M Systems Model 1800 and Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices)a height of 30 cm.

Equal amounts of protein 585 from extracts were separated by electrophoresis and transferred on a PVDF membrane.
